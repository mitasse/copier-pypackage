## ‚ö° Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

- Access to [Airbus Artifactory](https://artifactory.2b82.aws.cloud.airbus.corp/ui)
- Proper configuration of `conda` and `pip` for AWS ([Windows](https://confluence.airbus.corp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=388341419), [Giseh](https://confluence.airbus.corp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=388341601))
- Have a valid [GitHub token access](https://confluence.airbus.corp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=388341916)

## üöÄ Generating a project

Create a `conda` virtual environment:

```commandline
conda create -n copier python=3.11
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```commandline
conda activate copier
```

Install the `copier` and `poetry` libraries:

```commandline
pip install poetry copier
```

Grant `poetry` access to [Airbus Artifactory](https://artifactory.2b82.aws.cloud.airbus.corp/):

```commandline
poetry config certificates.aws.cert "path/to/certificates"
```

Depending on the platform you are using, path to certificate differs:

- for Windows: `"C:\\ProgramData\\.cert\\cacerts-airbus.pem"`
- for Giseh: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

In case of not found certificate, you can download
it [here](https://github.airbus.corp/connectivity/airbus-ca/blob/master/bundle/airbus-ca.crt).

Access token is also required. It is used as a mean of authentication to the API of Artifactory.

```commandline
poetry config http-basic.aws "username (e.g. doe, jane)" "token"
```

Please refer to the
dedicated [Confluence section](https://confluence.airbus.corp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=388341348)
to get an Artifactory access token.

On Giseh, we strongly recommend to override the cache directory to not pollute your `$HOME` directory:

```
poetry config cache-dir /projects/<my_favorite_cpd>/.cache/<login>/pypoetry
```

Go the root location where you want to store your package, create your project directory and go in it:

```commandline
cd /path/to/my_project_root
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

Generate the project using the `quickstart-python` template:

```commandline
copier copy https://github.airbus.corp/Airbus/quickstart-python-template.git .
```

Copier will ask you a lot of questions. Answer them to properly generate the template.

Once done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```commandline
conda deactivate
```

## üë∑ Working on a project

Dependencies and virtual environments are managed by [Poetry].

The first thing you do when entering your repository is to create a dedicated virtual environment:

Create a `conda` virtual environment into your freshly created project:

```commandline
cd /path/to/my_project
conda create -p venv python=3.11
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```commandline
conda activate venv/
```

Install the `copier` and `poetry` libraries:

```commandline
pip install poetry copier
```

Install all `quickstart-python` pre-defined libraries:

```commandline
poetry install
```

This will create the virtualenv the first time and install the dependencies.

Test that the installation worked:

```commandline
my_project hello
```

`Welcome to my_project!` should appear in a new tab in your console!

**You're good to go!**

## üîå Connecting to GitHub

Take a look to our dedicated [Confluence section](https://confluence.airbus.corp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=388341651).

## ‚úèÔ∏è Developer CLI

`quickstart-python` offers a developer-centric command-line interface to your application for testing, checking code
quality, auto-formatting and much more.

Feel free to discover all of them using:

```commandline
my_project --help
```

```
Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --doc      Open the documentation.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build         Command to build source distribution and wheel.
  check         Command to check the code quality, typing, docstring...
  docs-build    Command to build the documentation locally.
  docs-publish  Command to publish documentation to Github gh-pages.
  format        Command to run formatting tools on the code.
  hello         Command to check my_project is correctly installed.
  publish       Command to publish on r-fb40-propulsion-pypi-local...
  test          Command to run the test suite.
```

## üìå Updating on a project

Copier has an "update" feature. It means that, once a project is generated, you can keep updating it
with the latest changes that happen in the template.

It's particularly useful when you manage a lot of projects, all generated from the same template,
and you want to apply a change to all your projects.

Example: the template fixed a bug in the Makefile. You don't want to apply it manually to your
projects.

To update your project, go into its directory, and run `copier update`. Your repository must be
clean (no modified files) when running this command.
