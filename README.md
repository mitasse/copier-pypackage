**A faster way to build and share Python packages.**

Copier-pypackage lets you create packages in minutes, not weeks. Have some doubt? [Take a look.](https://github.com/mitasse/my-project) üîç

## ‚ö° Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

- Install Python 3.8 or newer
- Install Git 2.7 or newer
- Install [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## üöÄ Generating a project

Go the root location where you want to store your project, create your project directory and go in it:

```commandline
cd /path/to/my-project-root
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Generate the project using the `copier-pypackage` template:

```commandline
copier copy https://github.com/mitasse/copier-pypackage.git .
```

Copier will ask you some questions. Answer them to properly generate the template.

## üë∑ Working on a project

Dependencies and virtual environments are managed by [Poetry].

The first thing you do when entering your repository is to install the dependencies:

```commandline
poetry install
```

Test that the installation worked:

```commandline
my-project hello
```

`Welcome to my-project!` should appear in a new tab in your console!

**You're good to go!**

## üìå Updating on a project

Copier has an "update" feature. It means that, once a project is generated, you can keep updating it
with the latest changes that happen in the template.

It's particularly useful when you manage a lot of projects, all generated from the same template,
and you want to apply a change to all your projects.

To update your project, go into its directory, and run `copier update`. Your repository must be
clean (no modified files) when running this command.
